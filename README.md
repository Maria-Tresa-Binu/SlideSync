# SlideSync
Voice Controlled Slide Navigation
The objective of a voice-controlled slide navigation system using AI is to develop a hands-free slide control system utilising automatic speech recognition and wake word methods. This system aims to enhance presenter mobility and engagement by freeing them from traditional input methods. Additionally, the project includes the creation of QR codes for presentation materials, facilitating audience access for post-presentation review. Furthermore, the integration of a timer feature assists presenters in managing time effectively during their presentations.
